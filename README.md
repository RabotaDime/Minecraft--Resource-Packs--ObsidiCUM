# Building / Packing
I'm using separate folders system to nicely organize entire work on each aspect of any resource pack I create for Minecraft. With that approach you don't need to worry about messy bunch of files inside your pack. Each file or folder with "XXX" in its file name will be skipped. So you can keep intermediate and project files inside same set of folders in your project, but these files won't go to final ZIP archive (build result).

To build this pack into combined ZIP archive you need 7-Zip file archiver installed. And build scripts currently made only for Windows OS's (CMD).
